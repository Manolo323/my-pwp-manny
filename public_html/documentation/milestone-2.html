    <h1>Content Strategy</h1>
        <p>
            My site will be one page long and will be structured in the following sections:
        </p>
    <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>
            The welcome section will have a  short welcome message introducing myself and what inspired me to create this website. This section will have a large background image of someone playing a guitar and a nav bar that will be locked to the top of the website
        </p>
    <h2>The Basics</h2>
        <p>
            This section will cover the fundamental knowledge needed to understand the basics of setting up a guitar. This will include definitions, key terms, and tuning of each string with a mnemonic to help remember the strings notes at the bottom. There will be an image to the right of the paragraph of a guitar with numbers to label each essential of the guitar.
        </p>
    <h2>Step-By-Step Tutorials</h2>
        <p>
            This section will have the main content. It will provide detailed instructions on how to position their fingers and the name of each chord. I will also include diagrams and images of my fingers to demonstrate the shape of each chord.
        </p>
    <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p>
            For this section, I will include links to other helpful websites and diagrams for more advanced beginners. There will another large background image of a guitar for this section.
